üìÑ Customer Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews
Objective
The objective of this project is to perform a sentiment analysis on customer reviews of Amazon products to uncover key patterns, sentiments, and trends in user feedback. By analyzing the textual reviews and applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project aims to extract actionable insights that can assist businesses in understanding consumer satisfaction and product performance.
Dataset
The dataset consists of Amazon product reviews, each accompanied by various metadata including product ID, user ID, review summary, full text, review score, date of review, and helpfulness ratings. This data provides a rich source for analyzing customer opinions across different products and time periods.
Process
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation:
- Removed duplicate entries and null values to ensure data quality.
- Cleaned review text by removing special characters, HTML tags, and stopwords.
- Added new columns such as Review_Length (number of words in a review) and YearMonth to track trends over time.

2. Sentiment Analysis:
- Used the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) tool from the NLTK library to classify sentiments into Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
- Added a new column Predicted_Sentiment based on compound scores generated by VADER.

3. Visualization:
- Created a Pie Chart to display the overall distribution of predicted sentiments.
- Built a Line Chart showing sentiment trends over time using the YearMonth field.
- Generated a Histogram to analyze the distribution of review lengths.
- Optional color-coded charts were created to show sentiment breakdowns.
Insights
- Positive Reviews Dominate: The majority of customer reviews were classified as positive, indicating high satisfaction.
- Frequent Positive Words: Common terms in positive reviews included ‚Äúgreat,‚Äù ‚Äúlove,‚Äù ‚Äúdelicious,‚Äù and ‚Äúgood.‚Äù
- Negative Reviews Exist but are Limited: Some concerns were related to taste, product condition, or delivery issues.
- Noisy Tokens Removed: Tokens such as 'br', 'im', and other non-informative elements were filtered out.
- Time-based Sentiment Trends: Fluctuations in sentiment over time revealed by line charts may correlate with product changes or seasonal trends.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how natural language processing and data visualization can be combined to gain valuable insights into customer sentiment. By using VADER for sentiment classification and Tableau for visual representation, we successfully identified trends and patterns in Amazon product reviews. These insights can help businesses improve products, tailor marketing efforts, and better understand their customers.

This analysis serves as a foundation for more advanced techniques such as aspect-based sentiment analysis, product category segmentation, or predictive modeling based on customer feedback.
